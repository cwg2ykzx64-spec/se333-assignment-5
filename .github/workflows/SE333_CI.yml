      # Step 3: Run the Maven 'verify' lifecycle
      # This single command runs all steps in order:
      # 1. 'validate': Runs Checkstyle (as configured in pom.xml)
      # 2. 'compile': Compiles the code
      # 3. 'test': Runs all tests, and JaCoCo generates its data
      #    The JaCoCo 'report' goal is also bound to this phase.
